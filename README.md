# Overview

In this project I learned how to use Android Studio and Kotlin to make a tic-tac-toe mobile app.

The program is a 2-player game where you try to get three of your characters in a row and prevent the other player from doing so. Once a player gets three in a row the game ends. You can click the reset button to start again. It will also check for a cat's game, or  a tie.
